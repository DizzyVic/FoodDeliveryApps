********************** NOTE **********************
1. Data type of each column:
   	skip_id (integer)
	restaurant_name (varchar)
	restaurant_id (integer)
	savings_id (integer with the ability to have NULL)
   	refund_id (integer with the ability to have NULL)
   	delivery_date (date)
   	completed_delivery (string but works as a boolean (YES or NO))
	discount (string but works as a boolean (YES or NO))
   	total_price (float because it can have decimals)

2. Every restaurant has a unique id.

3. Each time there is a form of saving in an order, there will be a savings_id allocated to it.

4. Each time there is a refund of an order, there will be a refund_id attached to the order.

5. delivery_date works as days an attempt was made to order instead of when they were actually delivered.

6. total_price is the amount that was spent that day, even with a refund some money is usually taken by uber.

7. discount can be set to YES but skip the dishes doesn't tell us what amount was used as skip credit. Only the ones that are mentioned will I give them a savings_id.
