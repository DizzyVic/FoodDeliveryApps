********************** THINGS TO WORK ON **********************
1. Fine tune the schema

2. Consider making a new table to store the extra credits that are given after a refund.

3. Check if the refund amount in the refund sheet is already deducted from the final price in both the uber_eats sheet and skip_the_dishes sheet.

4. In the sheet skip_the_dishes, the correlation between savings_id and total_price is different. total_price will still has all the amount that was paid, so it hasn't deducted the savings from it to show the actual price. Same things with the refund sheet and skip_the_dishes sheet correlation.

5.
